        // Variables in Java

        // In Java, variables are used to store data values. Before a variable can be used, it must be declared with a specific data type and an identifier (name).
        // Here's the syntax for variable declaration:
        // dataType variableName;

        // Example
        int userAge;

        // After creating a variable you can assign a value to it using the assignment (=) operator.
        userAge = 18;

        // You can do the declaration and initialization on the same line
        int userScore = 90;

        // Data Types in Java
        // There are two categories of data types in Java: Primitive data types and Reference data types

        // A. Primitive Data Types
        // In Java, there are eight primitive data types, which are the basic building blocks for storing abd manipulating data.

        // 1. Byte
        // The byte data type is an 8-bit signed integer that can store value from -128 to 127

        // 2. Short
        // The short data type is a 16-bit signed integer that can store values from -32,768 to 32,767

        // 3. Integer (int)
        // The int data type is a 32-bit signed integer that can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

        // 4. Long
        // The long data type is a 64-bit signed integer that can store values from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

        // 5. Float
        // The float data type is a 32-bit single-precision floating-point number that can store up to approximately 7 decimal digits

        // 6. Double
        // The double data type is 64-bit double-precision floating-point number that can store numbers with a higher degree of precision compared to float data type.

        // 7. Boolean
        // A boolean data type represents two states - true and false

        // 8. Character
        // A character data type represents a single unicode character, enclosed in between single quotation marks
    }
